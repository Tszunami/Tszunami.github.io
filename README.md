The site, Tsunami Ventures, outlines my project portfolio
and experience working with data science and related fields. The
site begins with an introduction, Then a project section,
followed by my current skills with my contact information at the
bottom of the home page.

Each project listing has a link redirecting to the
corresponding project's page containing project output,
project development, and project details.
